THE ALLICIN DIFFERENCE. Allicin is the active component in garlic (beneficial to the immune system and circulatory system) that is released from a freshly crushed clove. We capture 5000 mcg of allicin in each acid-protected enteric coated tablet.


MORE CONVENIENT THAN A CLOVE. Our odorless supplement delivers the amazing health benefits of allicin sans eating a fresh clove. An enteric coating then protects the garlic from stomach acid before entering the small intestine, where it is most effective.


HEART-HEALTHY BENEFITS. The benefits of garlic have been widely known for centuries, and modern technology has made it possible to harness the most useful components to help support healthy blood pressure levels and overall heart health.


IMMUNE SYSTEM SUPPORT. Keep your immune system kickin’ with a daily dose of allicin. Garlic contains antioxidants that protect against cell damage, may boost immune cell function, and may help protect against oxidative damage from free radicals.


WHAT SETS US APART? At Zhou, we use only the highest-quality ingredients in a facility following GMP (good manufacturing practices). Plus, we test everything at our lab in Utah, so you can be confident that you're fueling your body with the very best.

B00IQT8IXS,Garlic Expressions,"
SINGLE PRODUCT SINCE 1993 | Why be average at a few things when you can be an expert in one? Meet Garlic Expressions, we exclusively produce a zesty vinaigrette dressing fused with pickled garlic cloves. Dub it a dressing, marinade, condiment, sauce, or your secret weapon in the kitchen – the flavor’s versatility adds a flavorful punch to any dish. The blend of a small-batch production process and premium ingredients results in the taste and aromatic standard for this two-in-one dressing.


COMMITMENT TO PREMIUM INGREDIENTS AMPLIFIES FLAVOR | We acquire the highest quality garlic from the prime growing region of California. Each garlic clove is sized and qualified by hand to meet our quality threshold. This process enables us to develop a subtle, yet full-flavored garlic taste that doesn’t overwhelm the other ingredients. Nearly all other products use dried or dehydrated garlic that zaps the full garlic flavor, we’ve chose the difficult method of only using fresh garlic.


VERSATILE FLAVOR COMPLEMENTS YOUR FAVORITE HEALTHY DISH | Dub it a dressing, marinade, condiment, sauce, or your secret weapon in the kitchen – the flavor’s versatility adds a flavorful punch to your favorite dish. Perfect for salads, meats, vegetables, starches, garlic bread dip, fresh pasta sauce, garlic sauce, and even pizza – the zesty flavor amplifies your favorite dish. Additionally, our ingredients are Non GMO Project Verified, Gluten Free Certified, Vegan, and Allergen Free, and Kosher.


CLEAN INGREDIENTS FIT DIETARY RESTRICTIONS OF ALL KINDS | Garlic Expressions’ bold flavor doesn’t mean you need to compromise on your dietary restrictions. This low carb garlic oil and vegan dressing is perfect for those who follow Keto, Paleo, Mediterranean, Atkins, or Weight Watchers diets. Made in a dedicated facility that does not handle any of the top 8 allergens: wheat, fish, milk, peanuts, soy, tree nuts, shellfish, or eggs.


PUT DOWN THE RANCH! | Taste is king, and we’re flavor royalty. Our meticulous attention to flavor details separates us from the rest of the pack. We’ll let the flavor speak for itself - compare us to Primal Kitchen Dressing, Tessemae’s, Annie’s, Sir Kensington’s, Brianna’s, Wish-Bone Balsamic Vinaigrette Salad Dressing, Colavita, Kraft, or garlic infused olive oil.

CANADIAN-GROWN & ORGANIC: Did you know that Canadian garlic is recognized as some of the best in the world? It's true, thanks to our cold growing climate. Our black garlic is Canadian-grown, hand-selected, and carefully aged for maximum flavour and our signature soft, spreadable texture. Organic garlic, certified by Quebec Vrai (OCQV).


SEE & TASTE THE DIFFERENCE: Black Garlic is completely different from fresh garlic—it’s aged in an oven at very high humidity. The process deliciously transforms the garlic in the following ways: Colour - it turns brown to black; Taste - it loses its garlicky taste/smell and becomes sweet and umami-rich; Texture - it becomes moist, soft, and spreadable with a knife.


HOW TO USE: Use black garlic to season any dish and build rich, umami flavours. Our unique aging process yields cloves with hints of sweet molasses and tangy balsamic vinegar. Use as you would roasted garlic: press, chop or purée, and add to meat dishes, seafood, pizza, pasta, and even desserts. The possibilities are endless.


SUPERFOOD SUPPORT: Rich in s-allyl cysteine (SAC), amino acids, polyphenols, and powerful antioxidants, black garlic is a recognized health food. Studies have linked black garlic to heart and brain health, a boosted immune system, and reduced inflammation.


100% NATURAL: Our black garlic is a natural product, selected by hand and certified organic. While each of our bulbs undergoes the same aging process, differences in colour and texture are normal and characteristic of this natural product. Ingredients: garlic.

HOW TO STORE YOUR OLIVE OIL: California Olive Ranch places your EVOO in dark green bottles to help protect the integrity and life of your oil. We recommend storing it in a dark, cool place to keep it fresh. Unlike wine that can improve with age, olive oil is meant to be consumed fresh.

They are also Whole30 approved, certified paleo, keto verified, and vegan friendly.

BLACK GARLIC: APEXY Black Garlic is a delicious, gourmet superfood. Starting as fresh raw garlic (Allium sativum), Black Garlic undergoes a fermentation process giving the garlic its distinct blackened color, sweeter flavor, and soft, chewy texture. Peeled and ready-to-eat, our whole Black Garlic cloves are a delectable snack and healthy accompaniment to your favorite dishes.


VERSATILE INGREDIENT: A melding of sweet and savory! Black Garlic has a date-like sweetness with tangy garlic undertones that add depth of flavor, pairing perfectly with a wide range of foods. Enjoy Black Garlic in salads, dressings, marinade, sauces, spreads, bread, pizza and more.


ANTIOXIDANT RICH: Better for you. When garlic is fermented, the compound allicin, which gives raw garlic its pungent smell, converts into beneficial antioxidant compounds. Adding this nutrient-dense Black Garlic to your diet carries potential health benefits, including controlling blood sugar levels and supporting heart health.


FERMENTATION PROCESS: Carefully picked at the same size and fermented under controlled high-temperature, high-humidity conditions for several weeks. APEXY Black Garlic bulbs are held at 140 to 170°F for 90 Days in the fermentation room and naturally aged an extra 30 days, resulting in a mild flavor and soft, glutinous texture.


NATURALLY GROWN & HALAL CERTIFIED: Simply the best! Unlike other Black Garlic products, our fermented single garlic cloves are 100% naturally grown without chemicals, peeled and packed whole without additives, and certified Halal. Everyone will enjoy the delectable taste and health benefits of APEXY Black Garlic.
