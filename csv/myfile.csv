Review

From the reviews of the second edition:“This latest instalment of the new Bergey’s adds to an encyclopaedic repository that provides an invaluable resource for all microbiologists, regardless of their areas of interest. … With its introductory material and indices, this volume approaches 1,000 pages, the quality of the content of which is consistently remarkably high throughout … and is illustrated with numerous phylogenetic trees and photographs. … should be available to all microbiology practitioners whether clinical, diagnostic, environmental or biotechnological, and in libraries for general consultation.” (Ann P. Wood, Microbiology Today, November, 2011)
