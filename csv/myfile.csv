CHILL DRINKS, NOT HANDS – Double-wall Vacuum insulated design; vacuum insulated design guards against diluting heat transfer to make super-chilled drinks while protecting your hand from painful frostbite; it also means no more condensation puddles on your counter, and clean-up is a breeze because this insulated stainless steel shaker is dishwasher safe!


THE PERFECT POUR – The Elevated Craft cocktail shaker has a super high-capacity jigger top; this patent-pending measuring system allows you to dial your mix from micro ¼ and ½ oz dashes all the way up to a full 6oz concoction; time to recycle your dainty shakers, mixers, and 1.5oz jigger and start making real drinks, with the brand new Elevated Craft cocktail shaker


NO LEAK-EASY TWIST - Twist-lock lid and top; no leak, never frozen stuck; our simple Twist-Lock system means no more sticky leaks or frozen stick frustrations


FILTERS ICE & SOLIDS - Built-in strainer; we tested dozens of strainers patterns and sizes until we found the perfect balance of a smooth pour at 45 degrees while holding back ice solids. The tumbler also works with most Hawthorne strainers.


CRAFTED PERFECTION & EASY-GRIP SHAPE - Unlike cheap glass and tin shakers, the Elevated Craft cocktail shaker is entirely made of Pro-Grade 18/8 stainless steel which will never transfer metallic flavor to your perfectly crafted cocktail; ergonomically designed concave curves mean no need for a crazy two-handed grip; just grip the Elevated Craft shaker anywhere that feels right and shake it up

Passiflora edulis, commonly called purple passion fruit, is a shallow-rooted, tendril-climbing, evergreen vine that typically grows to 10-15¡¯ long and to 3-5¡¯ wide and produces extremely showy bowl-shaped fragrant purple-white passionflowers (each to 3¡± wide) followed by edible, ovoid, purple passion fruits (to 2"" across).


This vine clings to supports by coiled tendrils. Individual flowers bloom for one day.


Each flower has 5 greenish-white sepals, 5 white petals and a decorative corona of white filaments which are showy purple at the bases.


Ripe fruits are edible off the vine or incorporated into a variety of food products such as beverages, jellies, fruit salads and sherbets.


Three-lobed evergreen leaves (to 3-8"" long) are finely-toothed, deep green and glossy above but dull green below. Young stems are tinged with red or purple. Glossy, three-lobed leaves (3-5"" long) with serrate margins have two small glands on the stalks.
