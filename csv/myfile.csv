HOMTIEM Black Garlic originates from Southeast Asia, it is made from fermented single clove garlic under carefully controlled temperature and humidity for 90 days.

Moreover, the main active ingredients and substances can help alzheimers, reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, controls high blood pressure, helps diabetes and blood sugar levels


We recommend consuming our HOMTIEM Black Garlic on an empty stomach, preferably before breakfast, as it gives you a healthy start and does not irritate the stomach. For a homeostatis effect, consume 1-2 cloves per day; For high blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol levels, consume 4-6 cloves as a recommended amount per day. We also suggest you to refrigerate the container of HOMTIEM Black Garlic after opening


Black Garlic is a health food that is ready to eat or can be used as an added ingredient to various dishes or recipes. You can use our Black Garlic to create a new menu, mix with your favorite salads, trail mix or any other recipes you deem fit

Fantastic addition to your home garden! Red Burgundy okra produces spineless pods that stay tender even when large! Sturdy plants grow 5-8' tall and red/burgundy velvet pods are 6-8” long. Okra loves heat, so gardeners with short growing seasons may need to start their seed indoors; plan to set them out 3-4 weeks after the last frost. Before planting the seeds, soak them overnight to encourage faster germination. Plant 2-3 seeds in one peat pot, and keep them at 80-90 degreesF until germination


Red Burgundy stays tender at its full length, and can be harvested at any length up to 7"". This variety is spineless for a painless harvest. Seeds are great for Planting in Garden or for storing in a seed safe for emergency.


Biennial. 55 days. 48-96"" height. 12-15"" spacing. Produces 6-8"" long dark red/burgundy, round pods.


USDA Zones: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12; Latin Name: Abelmoschus esculentus Type: Open Pollinated, Warm Season

B09C14V77F,True Salt,"
✔ The most mineral and nutrient rich sea waters attract the most sea life. Biologically speaking, the Sea of Cortez is the richest body of water on our entire planet, its waters contain 90 minerals and trace elements, and over 50,000 natural organic compounds, many essential to human health. That is the birthplace of True Salt.


✔ Other salts only offer high levels of sodium which result in a sharp, salty taste, True Salt has a unique flavor due to the high mineral and trace element content. These minerals and organic compounds - zinc, potassium, magnesium and iron among them - give True Salt a more complex flavor profile than refined, boiled, dead sea, or pink Himalayan salt.


✔ While other sea salts are made by boiling salt water in metal pots (which can contaminate the salt and destroy trace elements in it), and rock mined salt comes from ancient salt deposits with minimal organic compounds, True Salt is harvested from sun dried salt beds, preserving its unique characteristics, and full high grade nutrient profile.


✔ Use True Salt flakes on chocolates, caramel, popcorn, almonds, macadamias, crackers, pitas, everyday cooking, baking, grilling and bbq. Great as a table or finishing salt, or as a base for sauces, smoked salt, bbq rub or bath scrub.


✔ Bring out the flavor on mimosas, figs, roasted nuts, butter, whole foods, cakes, figs, edamame, fries, kettle chips, truffles, thins, sauces and roasted veggies such as sweet potatoes, okra and pumpkins. Great as a seasoning when paired with garlic, oil and black pepper.


✔ Available in a 3lb bulk bag, True Salt guarantees that you'll absolutely love the flavor andf our products or we'll refund your purchase 100%, no questions asked.
